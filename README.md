A collection of limerics i think of myself. Probably all reposts :)

Lovehack #3 - You hit the hand that feeds you, because you wanna be sure of their love.

Lovehack #4 - If you find yourself, you will find back to your family.

Lovehack #5 - There is one movie you cannot change; Life

Lovehack #7 - If you are in unanswered love, drinking beer only adds being drunk to it.

Lovehack #8 - If you want the world to change, care for your own household first.

Lovehack #14 – Never read the cover of a book

Lovehack #15 – Sometimes whistle how you wanna feel, instead of how you currently feel.

Lovehack #16 – Life is like Software. It's better when it's free.
